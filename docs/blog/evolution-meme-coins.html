                <p class="lead">Meme coins have evolved from a joke into a multi-billion dollar phenomenon. Here's how we got here.</p>

                <h2>The Beginning: Dogecoin (2013)</h2>
                <p>Created as a joke based on the "doge" meme, Dogecoin was never meant to be serious. Yet it survived, became tradeable, and proved that memes had value. DOGE went from worthless to $0.74 per coin at its peak.</p>

                <p>The lesson: Community and fun matter more than utility.</p>

                <h2>The Dark Age: 2014-2020</h2>
                <p>After the initial DOGE enthusiasm, meme coins became associated with scams and rug pulls. Thousands of worthless tokens flooded exchanges. Serious investors dismissed them entirely.</p>

                <p>However, a few tokens like Shiba Inu were quietly building communities. Waiting.</p>

                <h2>The Bull Run: 2021</h2>
                <p>Elon Musk's tweets about DOGE sent it to $0.74. Shiba Inu created explosive 100,000x returns. Suddenly, meme coins were mainstream. New investors poured billions into tokens with nothing but community support.</p>

                <p>This was also the peak of pump-and-dump schemes and obvious rug pulls. Regulators started paying attention.</p>

                <h2>The Maturation Phase: 2022-2025</h2>
                <p>Smart meme coin projects started adding utility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Governance rights and DAO structure</li>
                    <li>NFT integrations</li>
                    <li>Cross-chain bridges</li>
                    <li>Gaming and metaverse applications</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The best performers combined strong communities with genuine innovation.</p>

                <h2>Today: Data-Driven Discovery (2026)</h2>
                <p>MemeScout represents the current frontier: using AI and data science to identify legitimate meme coin projects from the noise. No more relying on gut feel or Discord hype.</p>

                <p>Professional traders and institutions now participate in meme coin markets, bringing liquidity and stability. The wild west is becoming a real market.</p>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>Expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stronger regulatory frameworks</li>
                    <li>More legitimate projects with real utility</li>
                    <li>Better tools for identifying winners (like MemeScore)</li>
                    <li>Integration into traditional finance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The meme coin market isn't going away. It's evolving into something real.</p>
